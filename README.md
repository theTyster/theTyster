# I'm [Ty](https://tydavisportfolio.wordpress.com)! üíæüêß

![greeting](https://github.com/theTyster/first-codes/assets/136642464/0725f9c9-c681-42a0-ae14-faa3f98789f7)

I am passionate about uniting people from different walks of life. I started my career in public relations and decided to make the switch to programming as I began to understand how much of an impact computers really have on our ability to communicate and build bridges.

My main objective as a front-end programmer is to make it easier for users to access the information they are looking for. Secondary to that, I want people to be able to trust the programs and software that they are using. A good front end really makes a difference.

## My Web Development Journey

I have been studying JavaScript every day of 2023. I have come a long way, but I still have so much to learn.

My personal goal is to create software that empowers users with:
- Privacy
- Transparency
- Integrations
