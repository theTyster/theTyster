</p>
I am a software engineer with a background in public relations and advertising. Engineering dynamic, interactive, engaging, and search engine optimized content is my specialty.

Everything I build is lean, fast, secure, and accessible. I am a firm believer in the idea that the internet should be for everyone.
  
Good tests usher good software. I meticulously test everything I build and can use any testing suite.
  
Typescript seems to be what I work with the most, but Python is a close second.
My database experience ranges from SQLite to PostgreSQL to NoSQL.
  
Recently, I have taken up creating my own SaaS built on Rust. (The code is not yet open but plans to be in the future.)
  
Flipping between front-end and back-end development is something I am fairly comfortable with, although I tend to work on the front-end more.

## My Web Development Journey

I started my career in public relations and decided to further it by focusing in on web development. The web is probably the greatest tool in modern public relations. 

My main objective as a software engineer is to make it easier for users to access information. Secondary to that, I want people to be able to trust the programs and software that they are using.

I want to create software that empowers users with:
- Accessible interfaces
- Transparent Privacy
- Seamless Integrations

## My Personal Tech Stack
I run multiple servers at home and have set up web servers for clients remotely. So, I appreciate tools that are portable and lightweight. 

Since 2019 I have been running Linux exclusively. After testing out lots of distributions, I settled on Debian and will run it on anything that has a CPU. 
Vim is my favorite editor.
