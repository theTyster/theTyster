# I'm [Ty](https://portfolio.thetyster.dev)! üíæüêß

![Greeting](https://github.com/theTyster/theTyster/assets/136642464/298e0bf5-1485-4f07-b90f-8e226521ebd0)

I am passionate about uniting people from different walks of life. I started my career in public relations and decided to further it by focusing in on web development. The web is probably the greatest tool in modern public relations. 

My main objective as a front-end programmer is to make it easier for users to access information. Secondary to that, I want people to be able to trust the programs and software that they are using.

## My Web Development Journey

I have been studying web development every day since January 2023. I've come a long way, but still have so much to learn.

I want to create software that empowers users with:
- Accessible interfaces
- Transparent Privacy
- Seamless Integrations

## My Personal Tech Stack
I run multiple servers at home and have set up web servers for clients remotely. So, I appreciate tools that are portable and lightweight. 

Since 2019 I have been running Linux exclusively. After testing out lots of distro's I settled on Debian and will run it on anything that has a CPU. 
Vim is my favorite editor.
